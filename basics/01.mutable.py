username="amit"
username="sumit"
when we change username from amit to sumit we never change amit, we change the referance username amit to sumit.
python has automatic garbage collection, and nothing has referance to "amit" so python automatically delete amit.
immutable means whatever referance has made on memory its never going to be changed, amit never going to be changed
